  Introduction to the project 
      This project is based on opencv and machine learning . 
      It gives you the real time Facial Expression Detection and predict what a person is thinking .
   
  The both training and evaluation operations would be handled with Fer2013 dataset.
      
  You can get the dataset from the given Link "https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data"
     
  To run this you have to open the terminal (cmd) then first run the "model" file ,then run the "camera" file , then run the "main" file at the end of this you will get
  localhost port no. run it in your browser , that,s all. 
    
  Technologies used are
         PYTHON
         MACHINE LEARNING
         OPEN-CV
